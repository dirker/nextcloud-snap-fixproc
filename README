Repackage nextcloud snap's with my personal fixes for environments with
relatively little processing power:

  - only spawn two php-fpm processes at maximum, to keep load and memory
    usage low (especially during thumbnail rendering)

Clone this repository and run build.sh. The script will:
  - download the latest snap
  - unpack the snap using unsquashfs
  - apply fixup.patch
  - repack the snap using mksquashfs
